Welcome, and happy new year.\
I'm Pear, an 11th grader from Vietnam. This is the first ever commit to my new, multi-aspect Project Emancipation, aimed at improving myself, everyone around me and the world surely with quantitative self-awareness and data-based actions.
In this general repo, you can see uploads of my own reflection log on a regular basis, project ideas, code snippets and more. As I progress, separate repos for dedicated projects and models will complement the general channel.\
Digital, especially software innovations have always fascinated me, and here is my chance to finally contribute to that hobby of tinkering with tech that I'd had from young. I hope to gain your support, feedback along the way, and wish everyone the best on the path to always pushing the limits of what humanity is capable of, dynamically and silently.\
